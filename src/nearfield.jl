    near_field_forces!(system, surface, ref, fs; kwargs...)

Perform a near-field analysis to calculate panel forces in the body frame.  Return
the modified `system` containing the calculated panel forces.

Note that this function assumes that the circulation distribution has already
been calculated and stored in `system`.

# Arguments:
 - `system`: Object of type `System` which holds system properties
 - `surface`: Matrix of panels of shape (nc, ns) where `nc` is the number of
    chordwise panels and `ns` is the number of spanwise panels
 - `reference`: reference parameters (see `Reference`)
 - `freestream`: freestream parameters (see `Freestream`)

# Keyword Arguments
 - `symmetric`: Flag indicating whether a mirror image of the panels in `surface`
    should be used when calculating induced velocities.
 - `trailing_vortices`: Flag indicating whether trailing vortices should be shed
    from the last chordwise panel in `wake`
 - `xhat`: direction in which trailing vortices are shed
 - `nwake`: number of chordwise wake panels to use from the wake stored in `system`.
 - `surface_id`: Surface ID.  The finite core model is disabled when calculating
    the influence of surfaces/wakes that share the same ID.  Additionally, if a
    surface/wake's ID is negative, the finite core model will always be enabled,
    even when calculating the influence of the surface/wake on itself. By default
    each surface has its own ID.
 - `wake_id`: Wake ID.  The finite core model is disabled when calculating
    the influence of surfaces/wakes that share the same ID. Additionally, if a
    surface/wake's ID is negative, the finite core model will always be enabled,
    even when calculating the influence of the surface/wake on itself. By default
    the finite core model for the wakes is always enabled.
